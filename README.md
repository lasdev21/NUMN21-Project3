# NUMN21-Project3
Repository for Project 3 in Advanced Course in Numerical Algorithms with Python/SciPy, at Lund University.

I started the code that can add rooms to an apartment. Currently you build rooms and pass them to the add_room_to_plan function. \
Run Apartment.py to see current output. Check out initialize_apartment_project3 to see how it is currently building an apartment.
